Tiny Discord bot for D&amp;D dice rolling

This is a simple discord bot that allows discord users to roll D&D dice with a simple command.

!rolld [die] 

e.g. `!rolld 20`

will roll a d20.

You're welcome to use this project as you see fit. It requires you to locally host a config.json file in the root directory.

which will look something like this:


```
{
   "prefix":"!",
   "token":"your-bot-token-here"
}
```
